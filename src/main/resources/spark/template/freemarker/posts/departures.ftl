                <h3>Departures</h3>
                <p>
                This week has flown in! I really did not expect to be grouped 
                up with a group of such socially capable people, and I’m glad 
                I have been because it’s been a blast. I have many cherished 
                memories already, most importantly the legend of Red Wine. 
                </p>
                <p>
                In Villiers I have taken on many personalities. Most of the 
                time I was the token Irishman with a horrible accent, but I 
                have also discovered my proficiency at “Mission Impossible”-
                style reconnaissance missions and being a sassy independent 
                black woman who don’t need no man.
                </p>
                <p>
                In all seriousness however, Villiers has provided me with 
                valuable experience that I will be able to carry on with me 
                in the future. I have learnt a number of unrelated mathematical 
                concepts such as the Four Colour Theorem and the maths of 
                juggling, I’ve learnt the complexities of code breaking and the
                Enigma machine, and I’ve learnt all about lambda calculus.
                </p>
                <p>
                I am very grateful to have been given this experience. Thank you
                to everyone on the course, and thank you Villiers!
